# PickandPlaceRoboticArm
This project involves using the OpenMANIPULATOR-X Robotic Arm in combination with a USB webcam to detect colored balls on a checkerboard, and sort them by color. Additionally, it can also detect other objects in the workspace and remove them, as well as pause the program when there is movement detected in the workspace.
